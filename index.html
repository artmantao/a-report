        <p>
          The survey was conducted online and targeted a sample of 1,000

          to rate their satisfaction levels on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being
          "Very Dissatisfied" and 5 being "Very Satisfied." The survey also
          included open-ended questions to gather qualitative feedback.
